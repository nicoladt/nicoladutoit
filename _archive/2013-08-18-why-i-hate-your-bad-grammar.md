I judge people based on their grammar, and here's why: 
Language is arguably the most profound communication tool we <i>Homo sapiens</i> have. Words have enabled us to share and pass on knowledge and learning for thousands and thousands of years. Words make us laugh, they make us weep and they make us rage. Words help us to describe and understand the world in which we live, and to communicate meaningfully with the rest of our species.

Words are not merely strings of letters, thrown together in random sequences. They are tasty, juicy brain-things, that can be manipulated and transformed to describe, elicit and enlighten. Language is a living, sweating, breathing beast. Grammar is the scaffold on which words hang, in beautiful strings of malleable, gleaming meaning.

Knowingly using bad grammar and willfully neglecting spellcheckers or dictionaries (particularly in this day and age!) is like stomping through a flowerbed of spring bulbs because you're too petulant and lazy to rather walk a bit further along a well-trodden path.

Call me a Grammar Nazi if you will. I prefer to think of myself as a well-educated, well-read linguaphile. I love words. I love reading them, speaking them, writing them, playing with them. They create worlds of meaning in which I have danced joyfully and wallowed luxuriously for years.

I love words in different languages. And I love the intricate meaning-space between languages. French verb conjugation fires up the puzzle-solving department in my brain. Earth-smelling Afrikaans descriptors regularly punch me in the gut. I recently saw a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam" target="_blank">Malayalam</a> poetry book which, despite being in a foreign script, danced off the page with its beautiful symbols and symmetry.

Words are my friends, my allies, my comfort in this chaotic world. They deserve to be treated with integrity and respect, not to be tossed around carelessly like tatty bits of garbage in the wind.


><b>Words are powerful</b>&nbsp;and they should be wielded with care.

Most often bad grammar just comes from a place of laziness. But sometimes, it stems from willful ignorance and this amounts to disrespect; disrespect for that which fundamentally differentiates us from our less articulate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae" target="_blank"><i>Hominid</i></a> cousins.

In this day and age there is simply no excuse for not understanding the difference between "to" and "too" or "there" and "their". There exists an entire fucking Internet to show you how it's done. If you know you're doing it wrong, don't laugh about it as if your illiteracy is cute. Get off your derri√®re and learn to speak and write your language properly.

Stop trashing the linguistic flowerbeds like a grunting gorilla and start walking along a grammatically-correct path like an articulate, intelligent human being.

(Disclaimer: this post is in no way aimed at second or third language speakers or writers, or at people with legitimate language woes like dyslexia. It's aimed at people who are supposedly fluent in their mother tongue, yet consistently (and knowingly) get their grammar and spelling wrong. We all make mistakes, but we can also learn from them. I'm not making any sweeping claims about my grammar being perfect, but I'd like to think I at least try to get it right...)

(Note: if there are any typos of grammatical errors in this post, I shall run myself on a sword post-haste.)

(<b>Edit</b>: there was an "it's" instead of an "its". It has been fixed, and I'm nipping off to shoot myself now.)

(Other note: bad grammar online reminds me very much of this gem:&nbsp;<a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">http://xkcd.com/386/</a>)
