The UX of communicating our UX designs

we spend hours tweaking wireframes, lovingly editing pixels and interface components. But w-hat’s the point if we don’t also spend time designing the document in which we’ll be sharing those wireframes?
-Spend days worrying about end user attributes, behaviours and so on but why not also worry about the other users/stakeholders who have to view/sign off on our designs
-Communicate clearly
-Document should tell a story as much as your wireframes do. 
-whether hand-drawn wireframes or a beautiful PS mockup, think about the user journey of the document explaining your design. Think about the users who have to read and understand your work - design a good experience for them too!
-Visuals have the greatest weight.
-use devices in mockups if possible (if spec is detailed enough/you know what devices you’re designing for) - helps contextualise design work (no matter how rough). at the very least include a browser/border box (e.g. if very early stages) to contain the design. 
-If possible only use text to support visuals, not to supplement. If you needs walls of text to explain a design artefact, perhaps you need to reevaluate that artefact. It should speak for itself. 
-Check spelling!
-Consistent, meaningful layout (like presentation)
-proofread!
-use legible fonts and colours
-Format correctly - use markup! 
-Think about file type. E.g. if files likely to be viewed on a variety of OS’s - export to PDF! GDocs corrupts .docx. 
-provide a table of contents upfront and page numbers - map the user journey for your document! Can even go so far as to include wireframe title in footer/header.
