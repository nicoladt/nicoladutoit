An acquaintance of mine recently put me in touch with a friend of theirs who is hoping to move into the (wonderful) world of UX design here in South Africa (admittedly still a pretty new field in these parts!). She was working as a developer, looking to move into UX but coming up against the age old issue of "but where is your portfolio?". The following is an adaptation of my advice to her. 

## Make a portfolio, no matter what
If you can't wangle any UX into your current work, then persevere with creating a portfolio in your spare time. This can consist of ideas that you evolve from concept to hi-fi mockups, or, if you can code, into functioning prototypes that can live on the web. 

A portfolio demonstrating 3 ideas that you conceptualised, prototyped with users (read: family and friends!), tested and built into a hi-fidelity mockup will get you way ahead of the curve.

##Document everything
The purpose of a UX portfolio is to show that you understand and can apply user-centred methodologies and tools. Yes, the final product should be included, but it's equally important to document <i>how</i> you got to the final product. It's like a high school maths problem: "show your way working!"

Don't be afraid of scanning any paper sketches and rough work - include that early-phase work in your portfolio. Companies are interested in seeing that you know how to evolve a product out of nothing, so document all your steps. If you hold an informal focus group say, document the questions you asked, write up a mini report summarising your findings and include this in your portfolio. It's important to show how you did your research and design, and to explain your thinking.

If you're not sure about which steps you need to include, do some reading about how the user-centred design (UCD) framework works. This forms the basis of all UX design. We use UCD tools and processes to design great experiences (wireframes, prototyping, eveything you learnt on the Deloitte training - that's UCD). An excellent book about what tools to use when is "Interaction Design", by Rogers & Preece: http://www.id-book.com/.

##Learn the software
Your wireframes look great. Balsamiq is a really awesome tool, and you've clearly mastered it so that's great. Other software you may want to look at for CV purposes are UXPin and Axure. Those 3 are the standards for UX design, along with Adobe CC. 

##Read read and read some more. 
There's an epic UX community on twitter. For starters check out these tweeps: http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/20-ux-twitter-accounts-you-should-follow-912782. They're always posting interesting articles and links. And then Google is, of course, your friend. There is a huge amount of really fantastic UX literature out there. This: http://www.usabilitycounts.com/2012/08/10/the-usability-counts-ux-resume-template-and-career-guide/ is a really good place to start, and also check out http://www.nngroup.com/. They have an awesome weekly newsletter too.

##Create an online presence. 
Build a personal website if you haven't already. Put your portfolio online. Keep it up to date. Blog, tweet, share. For some reason it appears that this is important in the world of UX. If you can post or re-share a couple or articles a month, it'll demonstrate that you're always learning, interested, engaged etc. Companies seem to love this!

##Come to meetups! 
Fairly often there are UX Masterclass meetups held in town. They're great and it's an awesome way to meet people in the field. The next one is in late July: http://www.meetup.com/UX-Masterclass-Cape-Town/. There should also be UXSA workshops in Cape Town later this year. Those are bound to be great.

##Have faith. 
You will find an awesome UX position that doesn't insist on years of proven corporate experience, but it may take time. Just keep looking, and keep applying. And be picky about what you apply for. Don't go for the "UX/UI/graphic design/developer" job ads, as I mentioned - those companies don't know what they need from the role. Keep looking on the SAUX Facebook page. LinkedIn and BizCommunity are the other places where UX jobs seem to pop up more frequently. And in the meantime, keep working on your portfolio. There's no shame in saying "well I couldn't do any UX in my current job, so I did all this in my spare time" - that says a helluva lot about you as a person and about your keenness as a UX designer!
