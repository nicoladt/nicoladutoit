I am a user experience (UX) designer, musician and lover of words. 

I believe that all users are experts in their personal domains and that we need to spend more time asking people what they want and need from technology and less time designing to satisfy other agendas. User-centred design can and does make the world a beautiful thing. 

I've studied a variety of things, including psychology, law, international relations, classical music, computer science and astronomy. UX turned out to be a serendipitious combination of a number of things that I love including people, psychology, creative design and careful, logical problem-solving. 

My most recent venture into academia involved an M.Phil. in IT from the University of Cape Town, specialising in Human-Computer Interaction, under the late Gary Marsden. I have worked as a professional musician, an author, a typesetter, a project manager and a front-end developer but UX design is where my real enthusiasm lies. I current work for <a href="https://www.pearson.com/" target="_blank">Pearson</a>: the world's largest education company and publishing house. 

When I'm not drawing paper prototypes and [grumbling about bad UX on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23ux%20from%3Asophdex&src=typd), I walk in the mountains with my dogs, drink wine and watch too much Netflix.
