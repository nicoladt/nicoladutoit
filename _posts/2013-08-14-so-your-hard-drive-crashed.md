title: So your hard drive crashed...
description: "Why I have no sympathy for people who suffer from hardware-related data loss, and what cloud tools people should be using instead."

In the last couple of months I've had to listen to a number of friends and colleagues lamenting the recently-occured, or impending crash of their hard drive/flash disk/computer, resulting in a catastrophic loss of data.

I have two, highly unsympathetic words for them: <b>cloud storage</b>.

In this day and age it is unbelievably easy to back up data. And not in the "copy it onto my five external drives and a DVD" sense of the word. I'm talking about syncing things into cyberspace, or, better still, actually creating them in cyberspace.

Hardware is fickle. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rot" target="_blank">Bit rot</a> is a bitch. As are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_rays" target="_blank">cosmic rays</a>.
Basically, any combination of silicon and solder ultimately results in failure, panic and tears.

But this blog post is not about the untrustworthy nature of hardware. It's about <b>why you should no longer care</b>.

There is a stack of gleaming, cumulonimbus clouds out there in cyberspace which can and will save your bacon and your files. In no particular order, I give you the five current rockstars of online file storage and synchronization.
<h2>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/" target="_blank">1. Google Drive </a></h2>

<div class="col-md-3 image">
<figure><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Logo_of_Google_Drive.svg/600px-Logo_of_Google_Drive.svg.png" height="100" width="100" /></figure></div>Imagine a world in which Microsoft Office was free. A world in which you could make documents online, view them, edit them, have them automatically saved. Imagine being able to use version control on those documents - to roll back to earlier versions, or review your history. Now, imagine being able to access those documents on any one of your devices. And, just in case this wasn't idyllic enough: imagine being able to share them with other people, who can then comment, edit, collaborate.

Enter the ninja: Google Drive.

Anyone with a Google account has access to Google Drive. You get 15GB of storage for free (that's a shit tonne of Word files, trust me) with the option to upgrade to 100GB for a whopping $4.99 per month. You never, <b>ever</b> have to save a document again, and you never have to lose one either. Your docs will sync on basically any device (most of which let you edit too), and best of all, you can share them, let people comment on them, and author collaboratively and remotely.

To give you one extreme use case: there's a small start-up in Cape Town who <b>use Google Drive to author school textbooks</b>. That's right folks: they author entire textbooks using Google Drive. Documents are automatically saved. They are shared with multiple authors, who work remotely and can write, comment, collaborate and edit in the same document.
<h2>
<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">2. GitHub</a></h2>

<div class="col-md-3 image right">

</div>According to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Github" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:&nbsp;"GitHub is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system". Git (the rock upon which GitHub is built) is revision control software, built by none other than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank">Linus Torvalds</a>&nbsp;(of Linux kernel fame). GitHub is basically the king of version control. If you have a bunch of people working on the same files at the same time, this bad boy will keep track of all those changes, and merge them appropriately. Like most sensible cloud services, they offer free and paid versions too, depending on your privacy and size requirements.


You can roll back repositories, clone them, merge them, fork them... You can create, assign and track issues. You can view stunning visualizations of who's changed what, where and when...

In short: Linus Torvalds and the GitHub team deserve a repository-shaped cake.

<h2>
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">3. Dropbox</a></h2>
<div class="col-md-3 image">

</div>
For those computer users who don't trust Google, or don't need the larny version control that GitHub has to offer, Dropbox is surely the most simple off-site storage solution. Dropbox gives you up to 18GB free (though friend referrals and social network sharing get you more data). After that, pricing starts at $10 per 100GB. Dropbox sits on your computer disguised as any other folder. And syncs the hell out of whatever happens in that folder. No need for backups, no need for tedious uploads. Dropbox will handle all of that for you. And, as with any well-synced data, you can access it from any device and from the web.


Dropbox is ideal for lazy users, who, like me, want offsite syncing and backup that can babysit itself. I recently upgraded to a premium account and am syncing 75GB of photos. Because I like to sleep at night.

<a href="https://evernote.com/">4. Evernote</a></h2>

Evernote is a brilliant tool for people who want to be organised. Content (in all shapes and sizes) can be organised into notebooks and folders, and labelled with tags. Imagine keeping track of a whack of PDF's, web clippings and notes for a thesis literature review. Now imagine those same documents neatly filed and grouped, with searchable titles and tags. And now imagine all of this organisation being available to you on any device and on the web. Who needs a personal assistant when you have an elephant?

</div>
Evernote also comes with a large suite of helper tools. The <a href="http://evernote.com/webclipper/" target="_blank">Evernote web clipper</a> is my favourite (for seamlessly saving bits of websites into my Evernote notebooks) but <a href="http://evernote.com/skitch/" target="_blank">Skitch</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://evernote.com/penultimate/" target="_blank">Penultimate</a>&nbsp;apparently come highly
recommended too. As with the other services, Evernote provides free access in exchange for (very reasonably) limited data, with premium, paid packages if you need more bandwidth. What's not to love about this pachyderm?

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">5. Flickr</a></h2>

Up until fairly recently Flickr was cool for sharing photos, but in my books wouldn't have merited a mention on a life-saving list like this. That was until they announced that anyone and everyone can now have <b>one free terabyte</b> of storage on their site. That's 1 000 000 000 000 bytes or 694 444 444 floppy disks (3/5 in 1.44 MB HD disks, to be precise). Flickr is the first site I know of to offer a tonne of free space like this, and hopefully, their new plan will put pressure on similar websites to do the same. (Dropbox, I'm looking at you!).


Unlike Dropbox, Flickr does not sync (i.e. you can upload only), and it's only meant for photo and video sharing. But you can upload your digital media, neatly organised into sets, with tags and licensing, until the proverbial cows come home. Flickr displays your pics nicely as albums, and of course there's a lot of community involved so you can easily share photos, write comments, join groups and so on. It takes some organisation and dedication to get set up but I know several people who are die-hard fans.

This list is by no means meant to be exhaustive, but it is meant to be enlightening. There really is no excuse for data-loss related alcoholism and depression these days. As I type this, I am smug in the knowledge that my Masters' dissertation and prototypes are tucked away in Google Drive (the writing bits), GitHub (the programming bits) and Evernote (the reading bits), and my photos are busily being uploaded into the Dropbox cyberspace, where they will be backed up on server after server and distributed into The Cloud.
