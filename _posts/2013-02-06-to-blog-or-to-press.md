I've had a number of cool ideas for blog posts recently, and so decided to log in to my very rusty Wordpress and Blogger accounts and see if I could resurrect an old blog to start writing again.
{{ excerpt_separator }} (This was long before my eyes had been opened to human-computer interaction and user-centered design). Needless to say, I am now absolutely stunned to see how far Blogger has come in the 3-or-so years since I last used it.


For one, Blogger has a much more "Googley" feel than it used to - for someone who uses GDocs a lot, even the fonts and menus look familiar, so I immediately had some idea of what to expect. Predictability and familiarity - tick. It's curious that it took Google so long to update Blogger. They bought the company in 2002, but in 2008 Blogger was still very tedious to use.

Moving on, customising the theme for my new blog was a doddle, with lots of advanced options (including an option to edit the HTML direct). Deleting and editing my decayed old blogs was really easy to do, and generally the whole website seemed much simpler to use than Wordpress. (The devil is in the detail, for example: Wordpress uses "tags". Blogger uses "labels", which I know and love from my daily use of Gmail).

I also love the Google+ integration. I'm not a huge Google+ user but given [it's now the second most popular social network](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-plus-surpasses-twitter-to-become-second-largest-social-network/57740/), this kind of seamless integration is probably going to be really useful in the near future. And I don't even have to think about installing silly plugins that will allow people to tweet, Facebook or RSS my posts.

And then of course there's Blogger's cute little WYSIWYG blog post editor... I doubt it does fancy stuff like maths equations at this point, but it sure beats Wordpress' TinyMCE, which has been the bane of my existence for many years. (As far as I'm concerned, the only useful button TinyMCE provides is the "HTML" button, for raw editing). and again, as a GDocs user, it's really familiar and easy to use.

This post has been a bit of an experiment - so far I've been far more impressed by Blogger's new look and feel than by my clunky old Wordpress account. I'm going to continue my little impromptu user test and publish this quickly...

<b>Edit</b>: Blogger even comes with baby Google Analytics bolted into the background. So far I'm impressed!
