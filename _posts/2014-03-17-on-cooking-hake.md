<p>I've never been a huge fan of seafood. When I was a wee lass my favourite thing in the world was fish paste on toast, but one bad experience with a tiny bone left me feeling forever mistrustful of supposedly deboned ocean-going creatures.

Nonetheless, a combination of post-thesis time and some dietary discipline (in order to become a lean, mean running machine) have meant that The Boyfriend and I have been trying to diversify our low carb diet. In order to do so though, I've had to become decidedly less picky about what I eat. Enter the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merluccius_capensis">hake</a>.

A few weeks ago we bought some <a href="http://www.woolworths.co.za/store/fragments/product-details/product-details-index.jsp?productId=20012052">frozen hake fillets from Woolworths</a> (de-skinned and deboned) and our first attempt at frying it was edible but not hugely successful. Tonight I decided to try again, and after digging about online for some inspiration I decided I would improvise. This recipe is dead easy, healthy and quick to make, and turned out to be surprisingly bloody delicious. 

<h2>Pan-fried hake</h2>
<p>(Serves 4, or 2 very hungry people)
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>4 frozen hake pieces</li>
<li>a bit of oil, for frying</li>
<li>a clove of garlic</li>
<li>salt, pepper, ground paprika (or pretty much anything else you'd like to use for flavour)</li>
<li>butter</li>
<li>a bit of plain flour</li>
<li>a dash of lemon juice</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>rinse the frozen fish and pat try with some kitchen towel (NB: don't defrost it!).</li>	
<li>fry the garlic in some oil, and remove from the heat.</li>
<li>melt a bit of butter in the microwave, and add the garlic, salt, pepper, paprika and lemon juice to the butter.</li>
<li>baste the frozen fish pieces in the garlic butter mix.</li>
<li>coat the basted fish pieces in flour.</li>
<li>fry the fish in some sunflower oil until the outsides are brown and crispy.</li>
</ol>

All the quantites are relative to how much fish you want to make (I had to melt a bit of extra butter to baste all the fish) but I don't think they need to be precisely measured out - just use common sense. I think it would go well with steamed veg, or just about any greens or salad. A nice, light, tasty meal!

(As an aside, I am quite appalled that I just blogged about food. This must be yet another symptom of my impending 30th birthday).
