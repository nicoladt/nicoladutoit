There are many ways in which one can do design work. The usual process I follow in my current workplace is outlined here. Although I am a firm believer in a user-centred process, due to external time and financial constraints, some recent projects have included far less usability testing and market research than I would have liked. Different projects for different clients and teams require different approaches, but user requirements should always come first.

<b>Research</b>: every project starts with research, be it into users, a brand, design guidelines and patterns, related products or all of the above. Before I draw a single sketch, I like to have an overview of who my users are, what they need to do, and how they should be able to do it. The result of this work is usually copious notes, use cases, workflows and a few possible site structures. 

<b>Ideate</b>: once I have a clearer sense of my users and the scope of the project, I hit my notebook to brainstorm, sketch, doodle and think. I experiment with different ideas, iterating rapidly to do a creative dump of all the thoughts, chaotic notes and design options in my mind. I am usually able to narrow a new design down to one or two possibilities which will form the backbone of the project, in which case it’s time to start prototyping.

<b>Design</b>: the official design process usually starts with paper prototypes that are the result of my initial brainstorming. Once a design starts taking shape on paper, I’ll couple it with sitemaps, wireframes and moodboards, to start putting flesh onto the project’s bare bones. I use different software depending on the fidelity of the mockups required. Sometimes hand drawn sketches suffice, but more often than not I land up working in Balsamiq, Inkscape or Photoshop because a picture really is worth a thousand words.

<b>Brainstorming</b>: once I have mockups in the bag, it’s time to sit down with my client (usually my employers and colleagues) and present my ideas. While it can be gruelling having a new design analysed and criticised, group discussions with team members and all involved parties provide invaluable insight and feedback. 

<b>Refinement</b>: input from group sessions is used to improve the design, which usually requires some tweaking and editing. Improvements and further feedback usually occur in a number of iterations until everyone is happy with the final design.

<b>Final specification</b>: much of the design work I currently do gets outsourced to external developers. If this is the case, depending on the project, the final brief will usually include a detailed technical specification, high-fidelity mockups, sitemaps and any other relevant technical or creative material that could be of use. Once everything has been collated it gets sent off to our developers.

<b>Development and testing</b>: whether development happens in-house or externally the implementation phase typically involves many iterations of development, further changes to design, and thorough testing. At all stages of the design process, progress is cyclical and work needs to be continually revisited and reassessed!
