Much to my horror, this blog has been dormant for months. I inadvertently did “one of those” - a nice rush of content up front and then nothing for ages because life got the better of me.

I’m not going to write a long and self-indulgent post about all the reasons why I’ve been to busy to blog but I will say this much: I started out writing a series of rather long posts. And that got me stuck in a bit of a rut where I’d think “ooh I have this great idea but no time to turn it into a 1000 word piece”. 

I’ve realised recently that writing short pieces, but writing more regularly is probably a better strategy. Much like an agile user-centred design process breaks up an enormous task into smaller bite-size chunks and iterates, blogging often and more briefly about particular ideas is a fresh approach which I’d like to try this year...

As the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Sandberg">Sheryl Sandberg</a> quote goes: “done is better than perfect”.
