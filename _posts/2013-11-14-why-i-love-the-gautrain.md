I was 29 years old the first time I rode on a train in my hometown, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>.

To many people, this might sound like a strange fact, but white kids like me who grew up in the Southern end of the Northern 'burbs in the 1980's and 90's didn't take trains or buses or taxis. Public transport, where available, was notoriously complicated, unreliable and often just not safe. Why would you use it if your parents both had cars and were (mostly) willing to spend hours of their lives driving you around?

Whilst there have always been trains going into Joburg and around Joburg, there have never been trains forming a network inside Joburg; trains that could get me to places I needed to be (in my Northern suburbs bubble); trains that could easily replace a parental vehicle. Joburg does not have century-old subterranean veins like London or Berlin or New York.

And so, I grew up believing that trains were really a thing that only happened in England and Europe and the rest of the First World. I traveled on trains in London, Paris, Rome, Berlin, Singapore and California, before I stepped onto one in the city I have lived longest.

I doubt very much that I will ever forget my first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautrain">Gautrain</a> trip from Sandton to O.R. Thambo airport. I was in Joburg for work - a 36 hour whirlwind trip - and by the time my mum had dropped me off at the station, I was tired and stressed out. She assured me that the ticket machines were really easy to use, but I knew I had to get a Gold Card (like London's Oyster card) and preload it with the correct amount of money, then find the right platform, get on the right train and so on and so forth. This I have done countless times in foreign languages, in strange cities, in the dead of night, and here I was doing it for the first time in my home city, more nervous, clueless and overwhelmed than I'd ever been overseas, probably because I had no idea what to expect.

Card and ticket bought, I was stunned by how user-friendly the machines were (mother is always right!). Things were looking up. I swiped my way through the turnstiles and then began the long escalator descent to Platform C, nine (!) floors underground.

I believe I was on the 3rd long and steep, Tube-like escalator when I heard that unmistakable train-whooshing-in-a-tunnel sound. It was completely surreal. A First World, European noise in a mad, gritty African city! London in Johannesburg - how completely bizarre!

The train journey itself seemed like a dream - cutting over highways and intersections that I knew so well. Clean, safe and so fast! Fifteen minutes from Sandton to the airport?! This was the stuff of Joburg dreams when I was growing up! I believe I sent an inarticulate SMS to my mum saying something along the lines of "<i>Wheeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!! Hehehe</i>". At the Ortia station, I walked straight into the airport feeling like I was in San Francisco again. I met my boss shortly afterwards and told him that I felt like a kid at Christmas. It was honestly one of the most exciting, exhilarating experiences I'd had all year.

The novelty of taking a high speed train in my own city, in my own country! The novelty of safe, efficient public transport not only replacing a road trip, but shortening the commute to the Airport to a fraction of the time, not to mention the stress! The novelty of taking just a few minutes to travel dozens of kilometres during peak rush hour traffic! All of this excitement I put down to Gautrain-virgin glee.

Until yesterday, when (several months later) I caught the Gautrain to the airport and rode on a Joburg train for the second time in my entire life. And hearing that amazing train-whooshing-in-a-tunnel sound, again brought a lump to my throat and tears to my eyes.

I realised yesterday that it is not a European or American noise, curiously displaced in an African city. It is not a London-in-Joburg sound. It is a Joburg-in-Joburg sound. It is the incredible sound of a country shifting gears and cruising along into the First World. It the sound of progress, burrowing away through the South African soil. Those tunnels smell of hope and progress and prosperity. The Gautrain is quite simply a symbol of South African future potential.

In my lifetime I have often wondered what this magnificent country would be like today if we didn't have an appalling history of oppression and bigotry; if all South Africans had been permitted to realise their full potential for the last four centuries; and if democracy and capitalism had been the norm for hundreds of years.

Because we can't undo history, I have also often wondered what future South Africa will be like. What will it be like to have efficient, affordable public transport for all? What will it be like when all of our citizens have homes and teachers and books and jobs? What will this country of Acacias and dust-rolling hills and smiles and dry bones and weathered hands feel like when it's managed to heal its wounds?

Catching the Gautrain today, I realised that we are already watching the sun rise on those rolling green hills. Whilst the past and much of the present is still painful and complicated and difficult to fix, future South Africa is already here. It's happening now, one train trip at a time, literally in the rich red soil beneath our feet.
