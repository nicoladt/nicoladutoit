<p>It's been an appallingly long time since I blogged. Almost a year. 2014 included finishing a Masters degree in IT and changing jobs amongst other things. Writing fell by the wayside. So there. Life happens. </p>

<p>Moving swiftly onwards into the new year - I've recently been asked by several friends for advice on setting up a website. Their needs range from simple blogs to professional sites for work. What surprised me was how much they seemed to think I may know about the weird and wonderful realm of the Internet. And then I remembered that building websites has become one of those things that feels really normal to me but is closer to black magic for most folks. What follows is a quick and (hopefully) handy guide on how to get started with a website.</p>

<h3>1. Decide on your budget</h3>
<p>Knowing how much money you're willing to fork out for your new site is important. Would you gladly spend ZAR50 000 getting a fancy, customised site built? In this case proceed straight to a serious design agency or web developer and get the job done by a pro. If your budget is more like R200 then the best option is probably to rent your own domain and go with free hosting (more about this later).</p>

<h3>2. Choosing a domain</h3>
<p>
What is a domain name? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name

One does not simply choose a domain name. Your domain name can say a lot about your website and your brand. Firstly, it must be easy to remember. www.thisismyawesomewebsiteitssocool.org.za is great example of what not to call your site. Secondly, it must be unambiguous to read, unlike expertsexchange.net or masterbaitonline.com. (For more entertaining fails have a <a href="http://www.boredpanda.com/worst-domain-names/"></a>read here</a>). Thirdly, believe it or not, domain suffixes actually have <i>meaning</i>. Don't call your site projectmanager.xxx unless your really <i>really</i> mean it. <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/num/domains.htm">Here's a helpful list</a> of domain suffixes and their meanings. If you're happy with a generic domain name like mysite.blogspot.com....</p>
