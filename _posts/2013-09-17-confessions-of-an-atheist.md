I am an atheist. I went to an Anglican primary school, where we dutifully said our prayers and sang hymns every day, and believed our teachers when they told us we'd go to hell if we didn't do our homework.

When I was 10 years old, I was struck by lightning in an appalling accident that left four classmates dead. And, whilst 22 children were left reeling with post traumatic stress disorder <strike>months</strike> years down the line, people justified this unthinkable trauma by saying that "God wanted four more angels to sing in his choir".

That was the beginning of the end of my relationship with the word and concept of "God". I started to say "I believe in Science, not God", and that's largely true. It sounds so impressive, but so clinical. And what does it really mean?

One day, whilst drinking wine and watching birds in one of the loveliest corners of the Earth, I realised that life itself is simply amazing. The tenacity of things to grow, and reproduce; of cells to divide; of organisms to evolve, is extraordinary. We have gardens and forests and deserts and oceans and skies teeming with life. And life has been teeming for billions of years, with organisms that all have their place in a very complicated natural system. The genes handed down to me by my ancestors are uniquely my own, and yet I share DNA with every other person on Earth. Everything is connected and yet it is all unique.

Science, and human intellect and perseverance have enabled us to understand how much of this complicated system works, and that is amazing too. What clever organisms we've become! And on top of science, us humans have art, music, love, words, feats of profound endurance, loyalty, courage and compassion.

And it doesn't end on Earth. I once met a person who declared that they simply couldn't bear to look up at the night sky: they felt totally insignificant and overwhelmed. I look up at the stars and I feel elated. My soul soars at the knowledge that, as Carl Sagan so famously said, "we are all made of starstuff". To look at a thousand tiny points of light, millions of years away, and know that we are part of all this and it is a part of us too...

I don't need to believe in God to feel deeply connected to the world in which I live. Understanding how light reflects to create rainbows doesn't diminish their beauty. Being able to analyse a Mahler symphony doesn't make those wrenching harmonic progressions any less magnificent. Understanding photosynthesis doesn't diminish the glory of a 400 year old tree.

>Understanding does not diminish wonder.

Reality is awe inspiring. The world, solar system and universe in which we live is sensational, complicated, mysterious and beautiful. All we have to do is wake up and open our eyes to that which is busily being alive and extraordinary all around us.

So then why do we, as a species, insist on believing in fairy tales, instead of in the magnificence of the real world?

>Why is reality not enough?

Or is reality simply too much for most people to stomach?

To quote Carl Sagan again:

>â€œScience is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality."

And because no post about the wondrousness of life is complete without wise words from Neil deGrasse Tyson (who says it better than I ever could):
