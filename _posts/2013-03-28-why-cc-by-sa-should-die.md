Creative commons copyright licenses are, in a nutshell, awesome. They offer flexibile, standardised, <b>open</b>, alternatives to the miserable " © All Rights Reserved" that is so prevalent in the world today. I'm not going to go into detail here about how copyright licenses are generally misused. I am, however, going to complain about how one particular open license is commonly used, and why that usage sucks.

According to creative commons (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/</a>), the Attribution-ShareAlike CC-BY-SA license:

>lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial 
purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations 
under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” 
free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia, and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects.

This sounds very noble in principle. People have to share your material under the same license, which means it will always remain openly licensed. A good thing, surely? <b>Not always</b>.

Here's a common use case for when it goes horribly wrong:

If you upload a photo to Flickr, the default "open" license option is CC-BY-SA. This results in the vast majority of openly-licensed photos on Flickr being filed under this license. (The same applies, to an even greater extent, to Wikimedia content and the comparable GNU license). However, you cannot use CC-BY-SA licensed material under the <b>more open</b> CC-BY license!

Most users will probably be blissfully unaware of this unfortunate caveat. I suspect those unfamiliar with open licenses go "oh, this is cool" without realising that CC-BY-SA is actually a 'closed' license for those of us who work in the CC-BY or public domain arena.

The simple two-step solution: firstly, the default licensing-on-upload option on huge repos like Wikimedia and Flickr needs to change (to be more open!) and secondly users of such sites need to be better educated about their licensing options.

We no longer live in a black and white world of closed vs. open. Open licensing has expanded to include many different flavours of openness. It's just a pity that some of those flavours act on others in a 'closed' way.
